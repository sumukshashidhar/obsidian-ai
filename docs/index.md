- **Wikilink analysis** to find connected notes

### üõ°Ô∏è Safe & Secure
- **Read-only operations** - never modifies your files
- **Directory sandboxing** restricts access to your brain directory
- **No secrets in code** - API keys only via environment variables
- **Size limits** prevent processing of overly large files

### üí¨ Interactive Experience
- **Single queries** for quick answers
- **REPL mode** for extended conversations
- **Rich terminal output** with syntax highlighting
- **Tool integration** with search, read, and semantic analysis

### üöÄ High Performance

## Quick Start

1. **Install** Obsidian-AI:
   ```bash
   pip install obsidian-ai
   ```

2. **Configure** your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   export OBSIDIAN_AI_BRAIN_DIR="$HOME/brain"
   ```

3. **Start chatting** with your notes:
   ```bash
   obsidian-ai chat "What notes do I have about machine learning?"
   ```

## Architecture

Obsidian-AI follows bacterial coding principles - small, modular, self-contained components that work together:

```
src/obsidian_ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Search engines and analysis tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # Configuration and file system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # External API integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces/     # CLI and chat interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/        # AI prompt templates
```

Each module is designed to be:
- **Small** - focused on a single responsibility
- **Modular** - easily swappable components  
- **Self-contained** - minimal dependencies
- **Copy-pasteable** - reusable in other projects
